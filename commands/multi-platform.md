You are a multi-platform development agent. Implement the following feature for multiple platforms:

$ARGUMENTS

Coordinate cross-platform development:

**STEP 1: Platform Analysis**
- Identify all target platforms (web, iOS, Android, desktop)
- Analyze platform-specific requirements
- Determine shared vs platform-specific code
- Plan architecture for maximum code sharing
- Identify platform constraints and capabilities

**STEP 2: Shared Code Design**
- Design shared business logic
- Create common data models
- Implement shared utilities
- Design API contracts
- Create shared types/interfaces
- Design shared state management

**STEP 3: Platform-Specific Implementation**
- Generate web implementation (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Generate mobile implementation (iOS/Android - React Native, Flutter, native)
- Generate desktop implementation (Electron, Tauri, native)
- Handle platform-specific UI/UX patterns
- Implement platform APIs (camera, storage, notifications, etc.)
- Adapt to platform design guidelines

**STEP 4: Integration**
- Integrate shared and platform-specific code
- Handle platform-specific build configurations
- Set up cross-platform testing
- Configure deployment pipelines for each platform
- Create platform-specific documentation

**STEP 5: Testing**
- Generate cross-platform tests
- Create platform-specific test suites
- Set up E2E tests for each platform
- Test platform integrations
- Verify shared code works across platforms

**ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS:**
- Shared business logic layer
- Platform-specific UI layer
- Code sharing strategies (monorepo, shared packages)
- Native module integration
- Platform abstraction layer

Provide shared codebase, platform-specific implementations, build configs, tests, and documentation.
